# Stanford-Algorithms

This is my implementation of all the algorithms covered in the MOOC, Stanford Algorithms.
These algorithms have been implemented in python.

- [x] **1. Karatsuba Multiplication**
- [x] **2. Merge Sort**
- [x] **3. Counting inversions**
- [ ] **4. Strassen's Subcubic Matrix Multiplication**
- [ ] **5. Closest Pair**
