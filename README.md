# Stanford-Algorithms

This is my implementation of all the algorithms covered in the MOOC, Stanford Algorithms.
These algorithms have been implemented in python.

## Part 1: Divide and Conquer Algorithms

#### 1. Karatsuba Multiplication
#### 2. Merge Sort
#### 3. Counting inversions
#### 4. Strassen's Subcubic Matrix Multiplication
#### 5. Closest Pair
